# AI-Artificial-Instructor
An algo that can take the place of your everyday gym instructor! This algo not only identifies various equipments for you but also suggest exercises that can be done with them. Other than this, it can correct your posture live time as well so that you can tone yourself unhinged.


It uses an algorithm called YOLOV3 which stands for ‘You only look once’ and uses CNN to scan the
equipment and identify what it is and thus redirect you to respective webpages showing how they
can be used. Another algorithm called POSENET will be used to view your live time position by
detecting your major joints of the body and connecting them to draw a stick figure which can then
be compared to an ideal posture and thus suggest corrections based on that
